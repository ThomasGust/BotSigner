# BotSigner
This is my final comp project for 8th grade. The GUI is really bad, and is something I will try to improve if I ever come back to this project. It's an ASL recognition app that I hope to eventually turn into an ASL learning app. Powered by an AI I submitted to the Kaggle Isolated Sign Language Recognition Competition.

The code for the GUI was a little rushed and the sidebar UI is taken from https://github.com/ingwant/PyQt5-Video-Book. Hopefully I will be able to improve this component of the project soon.

I also need to give shoutouts to Kagglers Mark Wijkhuizen and Henck23. Their code made it into this project in some way or another.
